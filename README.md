Code used in the paper "Structure and Shock Resistance in Financial Networks" by L. Zino, G. Fracastoro, A. Proskurnikov, and G. C. Calafiore

INSTRUCTIONS AND SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:

The code for the simulation is written in MATLAB, using version 2023a and requires no add-ons. All the functions needed are included in the corresponding folders. Hence, to run the code it is sufficient to open the corresponding folder with MATLAB.

The code has been tested on a PC with 16GB RAM and 10-core CPU 1.1 GHz with OS Windows 11 (64-bit).

ORGANIZATION:

The project contains a set of files titled "Fig#", which genenerate the corresponding figure in the paper. The other files are functions, used to generate the networks and compute the quantities of interest for the studies.
